/*
 * This test checks that various VolumeSources are working.
 *
 * There are two ways, how to test the volumes:
 * 1) With containerized server (NFS, Ceph, Gluster, iSCSI, ...)
 * The test creates a server pod, exporting simple 'index.html' file.
 * Then it uses appropriate VolumeSource to import this file into a client pod
 * and checks that the pod can see the file. It does so by importing the file
 * into web server root and loadind the index.html from it.
 *
 * These tests work only when privileged containers are allowed, exporting
 * various filesystems (NFS, GlusterFS, ...) usually needs some mounting or
 * other privileged magic in the server pod.
 *
 * Note that the server containers are for testing purposes only and should not
 * be used in production.
 *
 * 2) With server outside of Kubernetes (Cinder, ...)
 * Appropriate server (e.g. OpenStack Cinder) must exist somewhere outside
 * the tested Kubernetes cluster. The test itself creates a new volume,
 * and checks, that Kubernetes can use it as a volume.
